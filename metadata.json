Swift  Whereas the Northern Health Travel Grant was introduced in 1987 in recognition of the fact that Northern Ontario residents are often forced to receive treatment outside   their   own   communities   because   of   the   lack   of   available   specialist services; and  Whereas the Ontario government acknowledged that the costs associated with the travel should not be the full responsibility of those residents and therefore financial support should be provided by the Ontario government through the Travel Grant Program; and  Whereas travel costs, in particular airfares, accommodation and other related costs have escalated sharply since the program was first put in place; and  Whereas   the   Ontario   government   has   provided   funds   to   Southern   Ontario patients needing care at the Northwestern Ontario Cancer Centre to have all their expenses paid while receiving treatment in the North which creates a double standard for health care delivery in the Province; and  Whereas Northern Ontario residents should not receive a different level of health care nor be discriminated against because of their diagnosis or geographic locations;  Now Therefore Be It Resolved that the City Council of Sault Ste.
